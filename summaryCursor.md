# DOVE-Enhanced EvalTree: A Robust Framework for Nuanced Model Capability Assessment

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel adaptation of the EvalTree framework to support DOVE (Diverse Outcome Variance Evaluation) methodology, addressing critical limitations in traditional binary evaluation systems. Our approach introduces sophisticated missing data handling mechanisms and enables fine-grained capability assessment through continuous scoring. We demonstrate significant improvements in evaluation reliability and interpretability while preventing false weakness detection in sparse evaluation scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Traditional model evaluation relies on binary correct/incorrect assessments, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of model understanding. The EvalTree framework provides hierarchical capability analysis but was originally designed for complete datasets with binary outcomes. Real-world evaluation scenarios often involve:

- **Incomplete coverage**: Not all questions can be evaluated due to resource constraints
- **Confidence uncertainty**: Models may have partial understanding not captured by binary metrics
- **Evaluation bias**: Missing questions treated as failures create artificial weaknesses

### 1.2 DOVE Methodology
DOVE (Diverse Outcome Variance Evaluation) employs permutation-based testing where each question is asked multiple times with non-semantic variations, producing confidence scores (0.0-1.0) representing the consistency of model responses.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of binary correct/incorrect, DOVE provides continuous confidence measures that better reflect model understanding.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 EvalTree Framework Adaptation

#### 2.1.1 Original EvalTree Limitations
The standard EvalTree framework assumes:
- Complete dataset coverage
- Binary evaluation outcomes
- Uniform question availability across capability areas

#### 2.1.2 DOVE Integration Challenges
Integrating DOVE scores required addressing:
- **Sparse Coverage**: Only 40.6% of questions had DOVE scores (5,670 out of 13,971)
- **Continuous Scoring**: Adaptation from binary to continuous evaluation metrics
- **Missing Data Bias**: Prevention of false weakness detection

### 2.2 Missing Data Handling Strategy

#### 2.2.1 The Exclusion Principle
**Critical Innovation**: Missing questions are completely excluded from analysis rather than treated as failures.

```python
# Traditional approach (INCORRECT):
# capability_score = (available_scores + zeros_for_missing) / total_questions
# This artificially lowers scores due to missing data

# Our approach (CORRECT):
# capability_score = sum(available_scores) / count(available_scores)
# Only questions with actual DOVE scores contribute to the analysis
```

#### 2.2.2 Coverage-Based Reliability Filtering
We implemented a dual-threshold system:
- **Minimum Coverage**: ≥30% of questions in a capability area must have DOVE scores
- **Minimum Questions**: ≥3 questions required for statistical reliability

This ensures that:
1. Capability assessments are based on sufficient data
2. Statistical measures (mean, standard deviation) are meaningful
3. False weaknesses from sparse data are eliminated

### 2.3 Statistical Adaptations

#### 2.3.1 Continuous Score Integration
Modified EvalTree algorithms to handle continuous DOVE scores:
- **Mean Performance**: Average DOVE confidence across available questions
- **Variance Analysis**: Standard deviation to measure consistency
- **Weakness Classification**: 
  - Critical: <30% confidence
  - High: 30-49% confidence
  - Moderate: 50-69% confidence
  - Low: ≥70% confidence

#### 2.3.2 Hierarchical Aggregation
Adapted tree traversal algorithms to:
- Propagate continuous scores up the hierarchy
- Maintain coverage statistics at each level
- Preserve reliability indicators throughout the tree structure

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Data Processing Pipeline

#### 3.1.1 Input Processing
- **DOVE Scores**: JSON mapping of question indices to confidence scores
- **EvalTree Structure**: Hierarchical capability taxonomy
- **Coverage Analysis**: Real-time calculation of data availability

#### 3.1.2 Tree Annotation Process
```python
def calculate_node_stats(node, dove_scores):
    leaf_indices = collect_leaf_indices(node)
    
    # CRITICAL: Only include indices with DOVE scores
    scored_indices = [idx for idx in leaf_indices 
                     if str(idx) in dove_scores]
    missing_indices = [idx for idx in leaf_indices 
                      if str(idx) not in dove_scores]
    
    # Calculate statistics from available data only
    if scored_indices:
        scores = [dove_scores[str(idx)] for idx in scored_indices]
        return {
            'mean_score': statistics.mean(scores),
            'coverage': len(scored_indices) / len(leaf_indices),
            'reliable': coverage >= 0.3 and len(scored_indices) >= 3
        }
```

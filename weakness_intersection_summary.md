## üéØ **Actionable Insights for Targeted Question Generation**

### **High-Priority Targets (Immediate Focus)**
1. **Capability_18** (Score: 0.495, Priority: 3.41)
   - High weakness missed by binary evaluation
   - Generate questions targeting this specific capability area

2. **Missed Critical Capabilities** (1 identified)
   - Binary evaluation completely misses these weaknesses
   - **Highest ROI** for question generation efforts

### **Medium-Priority Targets**
- **Reliable Moderate Weaknesses**: Consistent performance issues
- **High Disagreement Cases**: Maximum evaluation divergence
- Focus on capabilities with low consistency (reliable measurements)

### **Question Generation Strategy**
1. **Target Missed Critical capabilities first** - guaranteed model failures
2. **Focus on consistent weaknesses** (low std deviation) for reliable targeting
3. **Avoid high-variance capabilities** - unreliable for consistent question generation
4. **Prioritize by DOVE severity + Binary miss penalty**

## 🎯 **Methodology Breakthrough**

### **Hierarchical Clustering Preservation**
- **✅ Real EvalTree clustering** maintained from MMLU.json
- **✅ Parent-child relationships** preserved across all depths
- **✅ Capability descriptions** kept from original structure
- **✅ Question indices** mapped to leaf nodes with DOVE scores

### **Readable Visualization Strategy**
- **Smart filtering**: Only shows clusters with ≥3 questions (reliable statistics)
- **Depth limiting**: Focuses on depths 0-4 for readability
- **Top weakness selection**: Shows most critical clusters at each level
- **Clean layout**: Hierarchical positioning with clear parent-child connections

### **DOVE Score Integration**
```python
# Aggregates DOVE scores by capability cluster
weakness_stats = {
    'mean_dove_score': statistics.mean(cluster_scores),
    'std_dove_score': statistics.stdev(cluster_scores),
    'question_count': len(scored_questions),
    'weakness_level': classify_weakness(mean_score),
    'coverage': scored_questions / total_questions
}
```

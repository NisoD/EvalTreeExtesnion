# Method Comparison: QualEval vs. DOVE-EvalTree Weakness Profiling

## Executive Summary

While both methods aim to identify model weaknesses, they represent **fundamentally different approaches** with distinct strengths and limitations. QualEval uses **dynamic capability discovery** with **AI-driven assignment**, while our DOVE-EvalTree method leverages **pre-existing hierarchical structures** with **robustness-based assessment**.

## 1. Core Methodological Differences

### 1.1 Capability Definition Approach

**QualEval Method:**
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Uses LLM (GPT-4o-mini) to discover capabilities from scratch
- **Data-Driven**: Capabilities emerge from analyzing question-solution pairs
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multi-round capability discovery and shrinking process
- **Example Capabilities**: "Algebraic manipulation", "Graph theory concepts", "Statistical inference"

**Our DOVE-EvalTree Method:**
- **Pre-Existing Hierarchy**: Uses established EvalTree taxonomies (58 MMLU subjects)
- **Domain-Structured**: Capabilities are predefined academic subjects/skills
- **Fixed Taxonomy**: Hierarchical structure remains constant across evaluations
- **Example Capabilities**: "Abstract Algebra", "Anatomy", "High School Mathematics"

### 1.2 Question-to-Capability Mapping

**QualEval Method:**
```python
# AI-driven scoring (1-5 scale) for each capability
{
  "1": {"reasoning": "Requires algebraic manipulation", "score": 4},
  "2": {"reasoning": "Uses graph theory concepts", "score": 2},
  "3": {"reasoning": "No statistical inference needed", "score": 1}
}

# Linear programming optimization assigns exactly 2 capabilities per question
# Constraint: Each question gets assigned to exactly 2 capabilities
# Constraint: Capability distribution respects prior probabilities
```

**Our DOVE-EvalTree Method:**
```python
# Direct mapping from dataset structure
# Each question belongs to exactly 1 subject/capability
# No AI interpretation - uses original benchmark categorization
question_id -> subject_category (e.g., "abstract_algebra")
```

### 1.3 Performance Calculation

**QualEval Method:**
```python
# Binary accuracy or win-rate calculation
capability_performance = sum(binary_results) / len(questions_in_capability)
# Results: 0.0 to 1.0 (discrete, based on correct/incorrect)
```

**Our DOVE-EvalTree Method:**
```python
# DOVE robustness scoring (continuous)
robustness_score = correct_responses / total_perturbations
# Results: 0.0 to 1.0 (continuous, granular assessment)
```
